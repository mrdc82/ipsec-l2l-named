# ipsec-peer-named
Output file where tunnel ip's are associated with a name

So i know this script is pretty rudemental in that it does alot of outputting and formatting, but, it works.

The script will log into your firewall that shows your site-to-site vpn tunnels, unfortunately the output does not show the business name.

What this script does it goes through the config file of the firewall device and does a bunch of formatting and outputting until you get your desired result.

Again, its rudemental, but works efficiently enough for my needs.

Hope this helps someone out there.

Cheers,
Dino
